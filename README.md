## Milestone Report 1

### Current progress

Scraper
- Implemented web scraper to get Amazon product review information from a given search keyword.
  - Implemented in Python with BeautifulSoup4 and requests libraries

NLP Sentiment Analysis Training
- Amazon review data set obtianed from Kaggle
- Understand workflows of how to preprocess text before Sentiment Analysis
- Researched into various NLP techniques used in Sentiment Analysis
  - Bag-of-words
  - TF-IDF
  - Word Embeddings
  - Word2Vec

### Reflection
- Our goal for milestone 1 was to implement a scraper for Amazon reviews, and train a sentiment analysis model on that data.
- We succesfully acquired our data, but haven't implement it with a model yet.
- We didn't fully understand the process of using a sentiment analysis model when planning milestones.
- Functionality (succesfully giving scores to text) was planned for milestone 2. Now it makes more sense that training a model on data comes hand in hand with functionality, so we will aim to do that for milestone 2.

### Next steps
- Having done enough research, we will need to choose a technique of our we will be qualifying our data. We will then need to actually implement the preprocessing, as well as feeding our AI applicaiton the data set from kaggle. 
- Combine the scraper to provide a data set to test our Sentiment Analysis algorithm on
- Create CLI for user to interact with
